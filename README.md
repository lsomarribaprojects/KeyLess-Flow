## What is SFlow?

SFlow is a **system-wide voice-to-text tool** for macOS. Hold a hotkey, speak, release — your words appear wherever your cursor is. Any app, any text field, any language.

Built as a replacement for [Wispr Flow](https://wispr.com) ($15/month). SFlow uses [Groq's Whisper API](https://console.groq.com/docs/speech-to-text) at **~$0.02/hour** — that's roughly **$0.60/month** with heavy daily use.

### Features

- **Native macOS app** — lives in the menu bar, no terminal needed, starts with your Mac
- **System-wide dictation** — works in any app (VS Code, Chrome, Slack, Notes, etc.)
- **Two recording modes** — hold Ctrl+Shift (push-to-talk) or double-tap Ctrl (hands-free)
- **Floating pill UI** — minimal overlay with real-time audio visualization bars
- **No focus stealing** — pill floats above everything without interrupting your work (native macOS APIs)
- **Auto-paste** — text appears exactly where your cursor was
- **Web dashboard** — browse, search, and copy transcription history at `localhost:5678`
- **SQLite history** — every transcription saved locally with timestamp and duration
- **Multilingual** — supports all languages Whisper supports (English, Spanish, French, etc.)
- **First-run setup** — asks for your Groq API key on first launch, no config files to edit

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS 15+
- Python 3.12+
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) (free tier available)

### Install (Desktop App — Recommended)

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/lsomarribaprojects/KeyLess-Flow.git
cd KeyLess-Flow

# System dependency
brew install portaudio

# Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build the .app
bash build.sh

# Install (IMPORTANT: use ditto, not cp -r)
ditto dist/SFlow.app /Applications/SFlow.app
xattr -cr /Applications/SFlow.app
```

Open SFlow from Spotlight or `/Applications`. On first launch it asks for your [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys).

### Install (Dev Mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lsomarribaprojects/KeyLess-Flow.git
cd KeyLess-Flow
brew install portaudio
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and paste your GROQ_API_KEY
python3 main.py
```

## Usage

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| **Push-to-talk** | Hold `Ctrl+Shift`, speak, release |
| **Hands-free** | Double-tap `Ctrl` to start, tap `Ctrl` to stop |
| **View history** | Click "Abrir Dashboard" in menu bar, or `http://localhost:5678` |
| **Start with macOS** | Toggle in menu bar → "Iniciar con macOS" |
| **Quit** | Menu bar → "Salir" (or `Ctrl+C` in dev mode) |

### Pill States

| State | Visual |
|-------|--------|
| Idle | Small pill with logo |
| Recording | Expanded pill with animated audio bars |
| Processing | Spinning dots |
| Done | Green checkmark (auto-dismisses) |
| Error | Red X (auto-dismisses) |

## macOS Permissions

SFlow needs these permissions (System Settings → Privacy & Security):

1. **Accessibility** — for global hotkeys and auto-paste (add your Terminal app)
2. **Microphone** — for audio capture (requested automatically)
3. **Input Monitoring** — for keyboard listener (add your Terminal app)

---

## Architecture

```
Hotkey (pynput) → Audio Capture (sounddevice) → Groq Whisper API → Auto-Paste (AppleScript)
                        ↓                                                    ↓
                  Audio Bars (QPainter)                              SQLite Database
                        ↓                                                    ↓
                  Floating Pill (PyQt6 + PyObjC)                    Web Dashboard (Flask)
```

Key technical decisions:
- **PyObjC/AppKit** for native macOS window that floats without stealing focus
- **Qt QueuedConnection** for thread-safe signals between pynput and UI
- **AppleScript** for reliable paste (pbcopy + keystroke "v")
- **sounddevice + queue.Queue** for thread-safe audio visualization

## Build It Yourself with Claude

Want to build this from scratch? Copy [`PRP.md`](PRP.md) and paste it to [Claude](https://claude.ai) (or any AI assistant) with:

> "Build this project following the PRP phases. Execute all phases sequentially, validating each one before moving to the next."

The PRP contains the complete blueprint: architecture, gotchas, anti-patterns, and validation steps. It's designed so an AI agent can build the entire project in a single session.

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development instructions and troubleshooting.

## Customization

All configuration lives in `config.py`:

```python
# Hotkey
DOUBLE_TAP_INTERVAL = 0.4  # seconds for double-tap detection

# UI
PILL_WIDTH_IDLE = 34        # pill width when idle (logo only)
PILL_WIDTH_RECORDING = 120  # pill width during recording
PILL_HEIGHT = 34            # pill height
PILL_MARGIN_BOTTOM = 14     # distance from bottom of screen

# Audio
SAMPLE_RATE = 16000         # 16kHz mono (optimal for speech)
NUM_BARS = 8                # number of visualizer bars
BAR_GAIN = 6.0              # bar sensitivity
BAR_DECAY = 0.80            # bar fall-off speed

# STT
GROQ_MODEL = "whisper-large-v3-turbo"  # fastest Groq model
```

## Cost Comparison

| | Wispr Flow | SFlow |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly cost | $15/month | ~$0.60/month* |
| Annual cost | $180/year | ~$7.20/year* |
| Data control | Third-party | Local |
| Customizable | No | Fully |
| Open source | No | Yes |

*\*Estimated for ~30 hours of transcription per month at $0.02/hour Groq pricing.*

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Pill doesn't appear | Grant Accessibility permission to your terminal |
| Pill steals focus | Verify PyObjC installed: `pip install pyobjc-framework-Cocoa` |
| Audio not captured | Check Microphone permissions + `brew list portaudio` |
| Paste goes to wrong app | This is the focus-steal issue — ensure PyObjC native setup works |
| Ctrl+C doesn't quit | Should work out of the box (SIGINT handler). Try `kill %1` |
| Dashboard not loading | Port auto-selects from 5678: `lsof -i :5678` |
| .app crashes (segfault) | Reinstall with `ditto` (not `cp -r`): `ditto dist/SFlow.app /Applications/SFlow.app` |
| .app blocked by macOS | Remove quarantine: `xattr -cr /Applications/SFlow.app` |
